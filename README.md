# Craiglist-Jewellery-classification
Unstructured Data Project

This was a course project to improve one of the sections of the Craiglist Website.\
Our team chose the Jewelry section since we found that there was no filter associated with the kind of jewellery one was looking for. \
Therefore, we built machine learning algorithms that would predict the kind of jewellery listed in a specific post based on the text description given by the user.
